## Put your RESULTS above here

Discussion:
Our myAllreduce implementation runs at roughly 127% of the MPI.Allreduce time (0.000026 s vs. 0.000034 s).
This is because the reduced overhead of performing a simple reduce-to-root followed by a broadcast,
which is especially effective for small message sizes. The myAlltoall performance is about equal to MPI.Alltoallâ€™s time (0.000041 s vs. 0.000041 s). 
Originally our implementation was worse due to the added overhead from managing multiple non-blocking operations and data copies, however, we were
able to improve the performance
