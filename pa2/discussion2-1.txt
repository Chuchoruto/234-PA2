Discussion:
Our myAllreduce implementation typically runs at roughly 127% (ranging from 105% - 150%) of the MPI.Allreduce time (0.000026 s vs. 0.000034 s), which we achieve by leveraging a simple reduce-to-root followed by a broadcast. This is especially effective for small message sizes thanks to the relatively low overhead. Our myAlltoall performance runs at about 100% (ranging from 120% - 90%) of MPI.Alltoallâ€™s time (0.000026 s vs. 0.000034 s). Originally our myAlltoall implementation was bogged down by added overhead from managing multiple non-blocking operations and data copies, however, we were able to improve the performance.
